KitchenSink/
===========

Welcome to the KitchenSink sample application. This is an app that shows some
basic features of Hirudo, such as error handling, basic page rendering or
method parameters solving.

The source files in this application are overly documented to explain the features
used.

What Goes Here
--------------

As explained at the previous *README.md* file, an application consists of two
folders: 

* [Models/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Models) That holds persistence layer (entities and components).

* [Modules/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Modules) That holds the business logic of yout app.

### Where to go now

If you want to know how to do things, go to the [Modules/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Modules)
folder; in there, you will find a series of modules each one representing a use case.

If you want to know how Hirudo models work, go to the [Modules/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Modules)
folder; there, you will find a sample model that consists on several entities and
a component that manages persistence.
