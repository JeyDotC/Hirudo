KitchenSink/
===========

Welcome to the KitchenSink sample application. This is an app that shows some
basic features of Hirudo, such as error handling, basic page rendering or
method parameters solving.

The source files in this application are overly documented to explain the features
used.

What Goes Here
--------------

As explained at the previous *README.md* file, an application consists of four
folders: 

* [assets/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/assets): 
In this folder you will put your web stuff, like *css, js and image* files. Also 
you can put your special templates like, the *Master.tpl* or *Base.twig* templates 
for example, but the latter is just a convension.

* [Models/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Models):
That holds persistence layer (entities and components).

* [Modules/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Modules):
That holds the business logic of your app.

* [ext/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/ext):
Here goes your configuration files and external libraries or just classes you
don't know where to put.

### Where to go now

If you want to know how to do things, go to the [Modules/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Modules)
folder. In there, you will find a series of modules each one representing a use case.

If you want to know how Hirudo models work, go to the [Models/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/Models)
folder. There, you will find a sample model that consists of several entities and
a component that manages persistence.

Or you can look at the assets [assets/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src/KitchenSink/assets) 
folder, where there is a css, a js and also a Master.tpl template that
serves as a base for all the templates in this sample application.
