src/SampleApp/
==============

This is the sample application. Here you will find a taste of the Hirudo 
capabilities. All the documents in here are overly documented with illustrative
purposes.

What Goes Here
--------------

Every application folder may have the following sub folders:

* *Models* the folder with the application's models.
* *Modules* The directory with the application's logic.

### Where to go now

You can go to the *Modules/FrontPage* to see some basic framework usage.
