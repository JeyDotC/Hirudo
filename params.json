{"name":"Hirudo","tagline":"HIRUDO FRAMEWORK","body":"*\\- To my lord Jesus Christ, who didn't scatimate himself for all of us so we could call him brother and friend.*\r\n\r\nHIRUDO FRAMEWORK\r\n================\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\n\r\nHirudo is a small, general purpose framework for PHP 5.3+ which goal is to abstract \r\ndevelopers from challenges of creating extensions for CMSs.\r\n\r\nIt's components mainly consist in abstract classes and interfaces so the different\r\nimplelemtations shall deal with the containing CMS details, generally using the\r\ncorresponding classes of the CMS and delegating the responsibility to them.\r\n\r\nThere are three implementations up to now:\r\n\r\n* The Joomla! version that works as a component [Supported versions: 1.5, 1.6(not tested), 1.7, 2.5].\r\n* The Drupal version that works as a module and creates a block [Supported versions: 6.x, 7.x, 8.x].\r\n* The Stand alone version that can live by itself.\r\n\r\n### About the name\r\n\r\n*Hirudo* comes from latin and means *leech*, that's because the framework ideally\r\ndelegates the implementation of it's functionalities to the containing CMS.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe Hirudo's documentation is, for now, a work in progress, currently you can see our\r\nTutorial documentation (starting below) or the [API documentation](https://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo-docs).\r\nBoth are made to be read directly in the repository they are in.\r\n\r\nIf you've been using Hirudo for a while, you can contribute to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/wiki)\r\n\r\nTutorial\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAs soon as there is an stable version and classes get fully documented there will be a \r\ntutorial to get you started with Hirudo, but, for now, I'll try to teach the \r\nframework with this approach: On each folder you will find a *README.md* file wihch will have\r\na section named \"What Goes Here\" explaining what is inside the directory, what\r\ncan you put in there, where to and where not to go from this place.\r\n\r\nSo, lets get started with this one, the root folder:\r\n\r\nWhat Goes Here\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIn this folder you can find the root directory of the framework, some important\r\nfiles and the folder where you are going to work. \r\n\r\nLet explain each one:\r\n\r\n* [composer.json](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/composer.json): This is the composer file, it tells composer what libraries this framework depends on.\r\n\r\n* [composer.lock](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/composer.lock): This file is generated by composer when it installs the Hirudo dependencies.\r\n\r\n* [ext/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/ext): Here goes the global extensions to the framework: plugins, smarty plugins, configuration, etc, those can be used by all applications.\r\n\r\n* [src/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src): Here goes your applications. In this place you will put your fantastic \r\napplication code.\r\n\r\n* [index.php](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/index.php): This is the main entry point for the stand alone version, it just instantiates\r\nthe ModulesManager class and makes it execute.\r\n\r\n* [hirudo.php](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo.php): This is the main entry point for the Joomla! version, it just instantiates the ModulesManager class and makes it execute wraped into a Joomla! controller.\r\n* [hirudo.xml](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo.xml): This this file installs hirudo on Joomla!.\r\n\r\n* [hirudo6.info](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo6.info),\r\n[hirudo7.info](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo7.info),\r\n[hirudo8.info](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo8.info): These files provide information to dupal so it can interact with the framework as a Drupal Module.\r\n\r\n* [hirudo6.module](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo6.module),\r\n[hirudo7.module](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo7.module),\r\n[hirudo8.module](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/hirudo8.module): These files are the entry point for the Drupal implementation of Hirudo.\r\n\r\n* [init.php](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/init.php): This file just initializes some stuff and creates a couple of constants, it's presence\r\nis due to the need to know the absolute path to the root folder.\r\n\r\n* [.htaccess](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/blob/master/.htaccess): All .htaccess files are configuration files that keep bad guys from lurking on your application files.\r\n\r\n### Where to go now\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to know how to **make an application in Hirudo**, the [src/](http://github.com/JeyDotC/Hirudo/tree/master/src) folder\r\nis your place, there you will find a sample application that tests some of the\r\nHirudo framework features and a neat *README.md* file with some explanations.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
